STLC phase with entry and exit criteria:
TLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle. STLC is a sequence of different activities performed by the testing team to ensure the quality of the software or the product.

STLC is an integral part of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). But, STLC deals only with the testing phases.

STLC starts as soon as requirements are defined or SRD (Software Requirement Document) is shared by stakeholders.

STLC provides a step-by-step process to ensure quality software.

In the early stage of STLC, while the software or the product is developing, the tester can analyze and define the scope of testing, entry and exit criteria and also the Test Cases. It helps to reduce the test cycle time along with better quality.

As soon as the development phase is over, the testers are ready with test cases and start with execution. This helps to find bugs in the initial phase.

STLC Phases
STLC has the following different phases but it is not mandatory to follow all phases. Phases are dependent on the nature of the software or the product, time and resources allocated for the testing and the model of SDLC that is to be followed.

STLC Phases
There are 6 major phases of STLC −

Requirement Analysis − When the SRD is ready and shared with the stakeholders, the testing team starts high level analysis concerning the AUT (Application under Test).

Test Planning − Test Team plans the strategy and approach.

Test Case Designing − Develop the test cases based on scope and criteria’s.

Test Environment Setup − When integrated environment is ready to validate the product.

Test Execution − Real-time validation of product and finding bugs.

Test Closure − Once testing is completed, matrix, reports, results are documented.

What is Entry and Exit Criteria in STLC?
Entry Criteria: Entry Criteria gives the prerequisite items that must be completed before testing can begin.
Exit Criteria: Exit Criteria defines the items that must be completed before testing can be concluded
You have Entry and Exit Criteria for all levels in the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

In an Ideal world, you will not enter the next stage until the exit criteria for the previous stage is met. But practically this is not always possible. So for this tutorial, we will focus on activities and deliverables for the different stages in STLC life cycle. Let’s look into them in detail.

Requirement Phase Testing
Requirement Phase Testing also known as Requirement Analysis in which test team studies the requirements from a testing point of view to identify testable requirements and the QA team may interact with various stakeholders to understand requirements in detail. Requirements could be either functional or non-functional. Automation feasibility for the testing project is also done in this stage.

Activities in Requirement Phase Testing

Identify types of tests to be performed.
Gather details about testing priorities and focus.
Prepare Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM).
Identify test environment details where testing is supposed to be carried out.
Automation feasibility analysis (if required).
